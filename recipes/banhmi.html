      <p>This banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich) is made with chicken and full of pickled vegetables. My husband works around a lot of Vietnamese restaurants, and I was making him bring me home these tasty sandwiches. Finally I attempted to make one, and found that my recipe was even better than the restaurants', mainly because I used chicken breast and fresher ingredients. I also love the pickled vegetables, so I make sure there are plenty of those.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>½ cup rice vinegar
    </li>
    <li>¼ cup white sugar
    </li>
    <li>¼ cup water
    </li>
    <li>¼ cup matchstick-cut carrots
    </li>
    <li>¼ cup peeled and matchstick-cut daikon radish
    </li>
    <li>¼ cup thinly sliced white onion
    </li>
    <li>1 skinless, boneless chicken breast half
    </li>
    <li>1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste
      ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 (12 inch) French baguette
    </li>
    <li>4 tablespoons mayonnaise
    </li>
    <li>¼ cup thinly sliced cucumber
    </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fresh cilantro leaves
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Step 1
  
      Combine rice vinegar, sugar, and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved, about 1 minute. Allow the mixture to cool.</li>
    <li>Step 2
  
      Place carrot, radish, and onion in a bowl. Pour in cooled vinegar mixture and let marinate at least 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Step 3
  
      While vegetables marinate, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the broiler. Lightly oil a slotted broiler pan.</li>
    <li>Step 4
  
      Sprinkle chicken breast with garlic salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Step 5
  
      Place chicken on the prepared pan and broil, turning once, until browned and no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes per side.</li>
    <li>Step 6
  
      Place chicken on a cutting board. Cut into bite-sized pieces.</li>
    <li>Step 7
  
      Slice baguette in half lengthwise. Pull out the soft center of the bread, leaving a cavity for the fillings.</li>
    <li>Step 8
  
      Lightly toast baguette under the broiler, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Step 9
  
        Drain off excess vinegar mixture after vegetables have marinated.
      </li>
      <li>Step 10
  
        To assemble the sandwich, spread each half of toasted baguette with mayonnaise. Layer chicken on the bottom half of the bread. Top with cucumber, drained pickled vegetables, cilantro, and jalapeno. Squeeze lime wedge over fillings and cover with top half of baguette.</li>
      <li>
        Step 11
        
        Cut into two 6-inch sandwiches to serve.</li>
  </ol>
