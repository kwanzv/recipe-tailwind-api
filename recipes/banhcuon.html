    <p> It is a soft rice roll filled with ground pork and wood ear mushrooms. You eat it with some fresh veggies and a little bit of nuoc cham. It’s just magic in your mouth. Yummm. Since I’m not visiting her this year, I decided to try my hand at making banh cuon for myself.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>1 cup rice flour
        </li>
      <li>        1 cup tapioca flour
      </li>
      <li>        4 cups room temperature water
      </li>
      <li>        1 tbsp vegetable oil
      </li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>Making the batter: Combine rice flour, tapioca flour, room temperature water, vegetable oil, and salt in a large bowl. Mix well and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>While the batter is resting, soak the wood ear mushrooms in a bowl of water for 20 minutes. Once done soaking, wring out as much water as possible. Coarsely chop them into small pieces and set aside.</li>
      <li>Combine the pork, fish sauce, sugar, and pepper. Marinate for 10 minutes and set aside.</li>
      <li>Making the filling: In a large pan, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium high heat. Add in the onions and cook for 30 seconds. Add in the ground pork and wood ear mushrooms and cook until well done (about 2-3 minutes). Set filling aside.</li>
    </ol>
